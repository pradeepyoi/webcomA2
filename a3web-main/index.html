  <h2>What is GIS?</h2>
  <p>You're not alone if you're asking this question! GIS stands for Geographic Information System. 
    It can be considered a workflow or toolset that involves analysis of spatial data and cartography.
  </p>
  <h2>How is GIS used?</h2>
  <!-- Quote taken from: https://www.esri.com/en-us/what-is-gis/overview -->
  <p>Hundreds of thousands of organizations in virtually every field are using GIS to make maps that communicate, 
    perform analysis, share information, and solve complex problems around the world.
    GIS helps users understand patterns, relationships, and geographic context. 
    The benefits include improved communication and efficiency as well as better management and decision making!
